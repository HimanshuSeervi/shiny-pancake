  <p>The software development process is a structured framework ensuring that software runs correctly. It typically consists of several steps: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance.
1.
Requirements: This step involves understanding and documenting the needs and objectives of the software. It often includes discussions with the business owner to gather information and asking questions about the desired functionality, and user requirements.
2.
Design: In this step, a detailed plan for the software is created. This includes defining the software's design, components, and user interface. This step helps establish a blueprint for how the software will be work/developed.
3.
Implementation: The implementation step requires writing the actual code for the software based on the requirements and design.
4.
Verification: During this step, the software is thoroughly tested to find and fix any bugs or issues.
5.
Maintenance: The maintenance step is to find any issues and making necessary improvements or modifications to the software once the software is deployed.
Computers and software are everywhere in today's world. And software design is one of the most important things when developing a software. Software engineers need to be equipped with skills beyond just programming. They must have the skills to plan, design, and implement them. Software design plays a significant role in making well-structured, maintainable software and meeting user requirements. It also helps create a blueprint for developers to follow during implementation.
One of the software that I use and find very well-designed is Google Maps. Its design benefits individuals unfamiliar with various cities, places, or countries. One of the features that impresses the most is its efficiency and the accuracy of its information, including real-time traffic updates and estimated arrival times. Another feature that stands out is the range of transportation options. For instance, if you're walking somewhere, you can select the walking mode, and Google Maps will automatically recalculate your route to accommodate areas inaccessible to cars and other vehicles. This versatility makes it an indispensable tool for navigation.</p>

  <p>During the requirement-gathering stage, the developer(s) must meet with the client to understand the issues they may face. To benefit from clean information, the developer needs to ask as many descriptive questions as possible instead of simply counting on yes or no answers. It is important to gain details about the problem because they cannot create a powerful solution without it. Therefore, after gathering all of the answers from the client, it's critical to put together a short summary explaining the problem and how it affects the clients.
1.	As a local bakery business owner, I want my business information on the map, including location, hours of operation, and contact details, so that I can have more customers for my business.
2.	As a university student, I want an app to see the bus routes and schedules so I can commute every day to get to my lectures on time.
3.	As an Uber driver, I want an app that tells me real-time traffic updates and suggests the fastest routes so my passengers can reach their destinations on time.
4.	As a traveller, I want an app that allows me to save my favourite places, like home, work, and preferred places, so that I can quickly access directions.
5.	As a delivery driver, I want an app that optimizes my delivery route by considering traffic conditions and delivery time windows so that I can complete my deliveries efficiently and meet customer expectations.
